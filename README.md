##Mockup Prompt Generator
This is a random text prompt generator designed to help artists and designers create unique mockups for custom artwork. The generator provides a random combination of living space type, architectural style, and living space descriptor to inspire the creation of custom artwork that fits seamlessly into a variety of interior design themes. The included orientation selection allows users to specify the orientation of the mockup, making it easier to visualize how their artwork will look in different formats.
